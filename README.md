# Proof of concept repository to test Typst to build my future resume

Warning, this project is under development, several parts are poorly done.

```sh
$ mise install
$ typst --version
typst 0.10.0 (70ca0d25)
$ ./scripts/watch.sh
$ evince ./resume.pdf
```

I was inspired by the The https://github.com/mintyfrankie/brilliant-CV project.
